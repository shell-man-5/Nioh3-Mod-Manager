# Agent Instructions

- Do NOT commit or push to the remote without the user explicitly asking.
- Before making code changes, reviews, or architecture decisions in this repo, read `skills/repo-continuity-notes/SKILL.md`. If the relevant repo context is not already active, then read `docs/memos/index.md` and the relevant topic memo(s) before proceeding, even for small changes.
- After approved changes that materially affect behavior, architecture, workflow, tests, sandboxing, or important gotchas, update the relevant memo(s) in `docs/memos/` and adjust the index if the topic map changed.
